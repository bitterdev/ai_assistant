# Ai Assistant 

AI Assistant is a powerful and versatile add-on for Concrete CMS that seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence into your daily content management workflow. Designed to save time and increase productivity, it brings the capabilities of ChatGPT directly into the CMS environment and empowers editors, marketers, and developers alike with smart automation tools.

With AI Assistant, you can batch-translate complete pages using AI, maintaining the exact structure of the site while intelligently translating only the visible, meaningful content. This makes it ideal for multilingual websites or international rollouts. Additionally, the extension includes fully automated batch SEO generation: the system analyzes each page, extracts relevant content, and generates optimized meta titles, descriptions, and keyword sets based on AI interpretation and best practices — all in just a few seconds.

One of the key usability features is a new button inside the WYSIWYG editor that allows users to instantly generate text using AI and insert it directly into the content field. Whether you need headlines, product descriptions, blog intros, or even creative suggestions — this tool brings AI writing right to your fingertips, context-aware and highly responsive.

AI Assistant also enables full-page generation via prompt input. Simply describe the type of page you want, and the assistant will automatically create a complete layout including appropriate block types and containers. It’s perfect for quickly prototyping landing pages, blog posts, or even full sections of a site without having to manually insert and configure blocks.

From translation and SEO to text generation and page creation, AI Assistant turns Concrete CMS into a smart, AI-powered content engine that simplifies complex tasks and speeds up content delivery without compromising quality or control.
